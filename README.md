# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a web application that could store notes for the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp, so that they me easily accesible for boot camp students.
- I built this project as a means to practice and cover the "bare bones" basics of some of the tools used in web development (HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript).
- The problem this project solves is that, as a boot camp student, I and others needed an easy and structured way to review prework boot camp notes.
- I learned about some of the important tools used in web development, specifically HTML, CSS, Git, Github, Gitbash, and Javascript. I also learned about some fundemental coding practices, such as the importance of debugging and the use of feature branches.
